Author's note is inserted only a few lines above the new text, so it has an larger impact on the newly generated prose and current scene.
- The Author's Note is a bit like stage directions in a screenplay, but you're telling the AI how to write instead of giving instructions to actors and directors.
- This is a good place to define the genre, tone, and maybe even some brief direction about the current scene.
- Author's Note shouldn't necessarily be that long, as it breaks up the most recent couple paragraphs from the longer previous text, so I aim for <50 tokens.
- Here's an example where I defined the genre, gave the AI a bit of guidance on how to show rather than tell, and gave it a focus to reinforce the kind of story I want it to tell:<br/>
    [This is tense sci-fi horror. Vivid, detailed descriptions evoke every sense. Visceral sensations and thrilling action convey a feeling of lurking danger. Aliens are gathering in the shadows outside.]
- Here's an alternative version that I'm currently using that works very well so far, with each part broken out into sections, but still under 50 tokens:<br/>
    [ Genre: Science fiction action horror.]<br/>
    [ Tone: Focus on gritty scenes, visceral sensations, and thrilling action.]<br/>
    [ Writing style: Give vivid, detailed descriptions using elaborate prose that evokes all senses.]<br/>
