## TPU Models
| Model | Style | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Nerys](https://huggingface.co/KoboldAI/OPT-13B-Nerys-v2) by Mr Seeker | Novel/Adventure/Chatbot | Nerys is a hybrid model based on Pike (A newer Janeway), on top of the Pike dataset you also get some Light Novels, Adventure mode support and a little bit of Shinen thrown in the mix. The end result is a very diverse model that is heavily biased towards SFW novel writing, but one that can go beyond its novel training and make for an excellent adventure model to. Adventure mode is best played from a second person perspective, but can be played in first or third person as well. Novel writing can be done best from the first or third person. |
| [Erebus](https://huggingface.co/KoboldAI/OPT-13B-Erebus) by Mr Seeker | NSFW/Chatbot | This is the second generation of the original Shinen. The full dataset consists of 6 different sources, all surrounding the "Adult" theme. The name "Erebus" comes from the greek mythology, also named "darkness". This is in line with Shin'en, or "deep abyss". |
| [Janeway](https://huggingface.co/KoboldAI/fairseq-dense-13B-Janeway) by Mr Seeker | Novel | Janeway is a model created from Picard's dataset combined with a brand new collection of ebooks. This model is trained on 20% more content than Picard and has been trained on literature from various genres. Although the model is mainly focussed on SFW, romantic scenes might involve a degree of nudity. |
| [Shinen](https://huggingface.co/KoboldAI/fairseq-dense-13B-Shinen) by Mr Seeker | NSFW | Shinen is an NSFW model designed to be more explicit. Trained on a variety of stories from the website Sexstories it contains many different kinks. |
| [Skein](https://huggingface.co/KoboldAI/GPT-J-6B-Skein) by VE\_FORBRYDERNE | Adventure | Skein is best used with Adventure mode enabled, it consists of a 4 times larger adventure dataset than the Adventure model making it excellent for text adventure gaming. On top of that it also consists of light novel training further expanding its knowledge and writing capabilities. It can be used with the You filter bias if you wish to write Novels with it, but dedicated Novel models can perform better for this task. |
| [Adventure](https://huggingface.co/KoboldAI/GPT-J-6B-Adventure) by VE\_FORBRYDERNE | Adventure | Adventure is a 6B model designed to mimick the behavior of AI Dungeon. It is exclusively for Adventure Mode and can take you on the epic and wackey adventures that AI Dungeon players love. It also features the many tropes of AI Dungeon as it has been trained on very similar data. It must be used in second person (You). |
| [Lit](https://huggingface.co/hakurei/lit-6B) by Haru | NSFW | Lit is a great NSFW model trained by Haru on both a large set of Literotica stories and high quality novels along with tagging support. Creating a high quality model for your NSFW stories. This model is exclusively a novel model and is best used in third person. |
| Neo(X) by EleutherAI | Generic | NeoX is the largest EleutherAI model currently available, being a generic model it is not particularly trained towards anything and can do a variety of writing, Q&A and coding tasks. 20B's performance is closely compared to the 13B models and it is worth trying both especially if you have a task that does not involve english writing. Its behavior will be similar to the GPT-J-6B model since they are trained on the same dataset but with more sensitivity towards repetition penalty and with more knowledge. |
| [OPT](https://huggingface.co/facebook/opt-13b) by Metaseq | Generic | OPT is considered one of the best base models as far as content goes, its behavior has the strengths of both GPT-Neo and Fairseq Dense. Compared to Neo duplicate and unnecessary content has been left out, while additional literature was added in similar to the Fairseq Dense model. The Fairseq Dense model however lacks the broader data that OPT does have. The biggest downfall of OPT is its license, which prohibits any commercial usage, or usage beyond research purposes. |
| [Fairseq Dense](https://huggingface.co/KoboldAI/fairseq-dense-13B) by Facebook Researchers | Generic | Trained by Facebook Researchers this model stems from the MOE research project within Fairseq. This particular version has been converted by us for use in KoboldAI. It is known to be on par with the larger 20B model from EleutherAI and considered as better for pop culture and language tasks. Because the model has never seen a new line (enter) it may perform worse on formatting and paragraphing. |
| [GPT-J-6B](https://huggingface.co/EleutherAI/gpt-j-6B) by EleutherAI | Generic | This model serves as the basis for most other 6B models (Some being based on Fairseq Dense instead). Being trained on the Pile and not biased towards anything in particular it is suitable for a variety of tasks such as writing, Q&A and coding tasks. You will likely get better result with larger generic models or finetuned models. |

| [Picard](https://huggingface.co/KoboldAI/GPT-Neo-2.7B-Picard) by Mr Seeker | Novel | Picard is a model trained for SFW Novels based on Neo 2.7B. It is focused on Novel style writing without the NSFW bias. While the name suggests a sci-fi model this model is designed for Novels of a variety of genre's. It is meant to be used in KoboldAI's regular mode. |
| [AID](https://huggingface.co/KoboldAI/GPT-Neo-2.7B-AID) by melastacho | Adventure | Also know as Adventure 2.7B this is a clone of the AI Dungeon Classic model and is best known for the epic wackey adventures that AI Dungeon Classic players love. |
| [Horni LN](https://huggingface.co/KoboldAI/GPT-Neo-2.7B-Horni-LN) by finetune | Novel | This model is based on Horni 2.7B and retains its NSFW knowledge, but was then further biased towards SFW novel stories. If you seek a balance between a SFW Novel model and a NSFW model this model should be a good choice. |
| [Horni](https://huggingface.co/KoboldAI/GPT-Neo-2.7B-Horni) by finetune | NSFW | This model is tuned on Literotica to produce a Novel style model biased towards NSFW content. Can still be used for SFW stories but will have a bias towards NSFW content. It is meant to be used in KoboldAI's regular mode. |
| [Neo](https://huggingface.co/EleutherAI/gpt-neo-2.7B) by EleutherAI | Generic | This is the base model for all the other 2.7B models, it is best used when you have a use case that we have no other models available for, such as writing blog articles or programming. It can also be a good basis for the experience of some of the softprompts if your softprompt is not about a subject the other models cover. |
## Styles
| Style | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Novel | For regular story writing, not compatible with Adventure mode or other specialty modes. |
| NSFW | Indicates that the model is strongly biased towards NSFW content and is not suitable for children, work environments or livestreaming. Most NSFW models are also Novel models in nature. |
| Chatbot | Models that have been reported to work well in chat mode. In the absence of models specially trained for use as a chatbot, can perform their role. |
| Adventure | These models are excellent for people willing to play KoboldAI like a Text Adventure game and are meant to be used with Adventure mode enabled. Even if you wish to use it as a Novel style model you should always have Adventure mode on and set it to story. These models typically have a strong bias towards the use of the word You and without Adventure mode enabled break the story flow and write actions on your behalf. |
| Generic | Generic models are not trained towards anything specific, typically used as a basis for other tasks and models. They can do everything the other models can do, but require much more handholding to work properly. Generic models are an ideal basis for tasks that we have no specific model for, or for experiencing a softprompt in its raw form. |
