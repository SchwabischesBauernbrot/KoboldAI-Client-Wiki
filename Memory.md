# Memory

Memory is inserted at the very top of what is sent to the AI, so it is the first thing that the AI sees every time you click Send. However, it's also the farthest away from the new text that is actively being generated, so it may have less obvious impact on current scene.

- Think of Memory like the summary in the dust jacket of a book, or the back of a movie, or a Netflix menu.
- Use it to introduce the main theme(s) of your story, the broad strokes of the setting, central conflict(s), and protagonist. You might even devote a paragraph to each.
- It's worth spending a few hundred tokens on this. A typical paragraph might be between 50-100 tokens, so I aim for around 200 tokens total (one tenth of the 2048 token budget with the Sigurd model).
- Here's an example where I introduced the setting, main conflict, and protagonist:

[In an isolated colony on a distant, barren planet, a small community of human colonists struggles to survive and build agriculture and industry. As the only people on the planet, they can only depend on one another, while their equipment and advanced technology frequently malfunctions.]

[Unknown to most of the colonists, their colony is secretly located above an underground alien hive so the company can study the alien species. However, the aliens are dangerous and uncontrollable, and the alien hive mind is slowly becoming aware of the human colonists on the surface above them. The aliens are beginning to stalk and ambush colonists, and may soon attack.]

[Nora Decker is a tough and determined young woman working as an engineer in the colony. Nora is smart and perceptive, with a keen eye for problems and opportunities. Nora is athletic and quick with green eyes and dark black hair. Nora wears utility pants and a matching light jacket over a greasy work shirt.]
